Here you will find the codes to make plots from the data generated by `RAMSES` and `RASCAS` using the main codes. 

Use `plot_21cm.py` for single planel plots of Ly$\alpha$ coupling and 21-cm signal.

Use `2byb2_plots.py` to create the 4 panel plots like figure 3 and 5 in our paper.

Use `compare_xa.py` and `compare_T21.py` for making 6 panelled plots as in figure 6 and 7, respectively.

Use `ind_diff.py` for making single planel plots showing difference of LyÎ± coupling or 21-cm signal as well as making distribution (a histogram) of the difference.

`nu.py` can be used to compare the output and input frequencies of MC photons. Also, use this to check the SED of the input photons. We used a Pop-II model from Barkana & Loeb (2005) for which SED$`\propto \nu^{-0.86}`$ (by number per frequency). See `SED.pdf`.

`od.py` can be used to get the total optical depth of the Monte Carlo photons.
