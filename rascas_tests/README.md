Here you will find the codes to analyse and plot the results of some test cases of `RASCAS` done in Appendix A in paper. The data files are large and hence not uploaded here. Please contact me if required. 

`static.py` for reproducing fig. A1. Static homogenous sphere. Source emitting monochromatically from the centre. 

`radial_vs_hubble.ipynb` for reproducing fig. A2. To compare the output spectrum from a radially-expanding medium with a true-Hubble-expanding medium. Source emitting monochromatically from the centre.

`radial_palpha.ipynb` for reproducing fig. A3. Radial profile of the scattering rate per atom, i.e., $`P_{\alpha}=P_{\alpha}(r)`$. Source emitting monochromatically from the centre.

`jr_nu.ipynb` for reproducing fig. A4. Truly Hubble expanding medium at $`T = 0\,`$K. Source emitting monochromatically from the centre.
